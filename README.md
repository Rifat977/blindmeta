# Blindmeta
Blindmeta is a web based project mainly for blind people. An increasing number of studies have used technology to help blind people to integrate more fully into a global world. We present software to use mobile devices by blind users. The software considers a system of voice messenger to favor interaction of blind users with any other user connected to the network. The integration of the designed modules into a communication system helped us to create a messenger system specially tailored to people with visual disabilities. Another very helpful feature of this project is the virtual assistant. It will help a blind person in many tasks automatically.
